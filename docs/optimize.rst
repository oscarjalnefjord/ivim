Protocol optimization
**************************************

The precision and accuracy of estimated IVIM parameters depend on the 
imaging parameters, in particular choice of b-values and similar parameters.
Several methods for protocol optimization exist, all with the pros and cons.
The algorithm for protocol optimization provided in this package builds on 
minimization of the Cram√©r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), which is a measure of the 
theoretically lowest variance of an estimated parameter given an experimental
setup.\ [1]_ The algorithm implemented in this package has been used to optimize
b-values for the simplified IVIM model.\ [2]_ The function here does however
provide compatibility with models in all regimes, and both monopolar and bipolar
diffusion encoding (:func:`API <ivim.optimize.crlb>`).
