The `ivim` python package provides functionality for the main steps associated with IVIM analysis of diffusion MRI data including:
- Methods for IVIM parameter estimation / model fitting
- Simulation of MRI data based on IVIM models
- Optimization of b-values 
- Preprocessing, both basic operation like extracting image data with a specific b-value or averaging of diffusion encoding directions, and specific methods like correction for signal drift

The file formats used are the ones used by [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSL), i.e. .nii.gz for image data, .bval for b-values and .bvec for diffusion encoding directions. File with ending .cval is also used for c-values in analogy to .bval for b-values to describe flow encoding.

## Dependencies
The `ivim` python package relies heavly on numpy for numerical operations, uses nibabel for reading and writing nifti file, and uses scipy for some specific minimization/optimization tasks. A python version >= 3.10 is required.

The correction for susceptibility and eddy current induced distorsions wraps FSL functionality, thus requiring [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSL) to be installed.

## How to install
The suggested way to install is to first prepare an environment suitable for the `ivim` package using e.g. conda with a compatible python version (>= 3.10):

    conda create -n ivim python == 3.10

Activate the environment and install the prerequisities:

    conda activate ivim
    conda install -c anaconda -c conda-forge nibabel scipy numpy

Download the package with:

    git clone https://github.com/oscarjalnefjord/ivim.git

To install the package, run:

    pip install -e ivim

If you are not in the directory of the repository, run:

    pip install -e /path/to/ivim

where `/path/to/ivim` points to the directory of the repository.
